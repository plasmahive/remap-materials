This Blender addon was written for version 4.3.2, but it works starting at version 3.0.0

This is my first addon and I hope to make more in the future!

To use this addon, simly right click on a material in the OUTLINER in the Blender File display mode.
You will see an option with a material icon labeled Remap Materials

After clicking Remap Materials, a popup menu will open for you to select a material.
Select a material and hit OK. Afterwards, all of the selected materials from the outliner will be remapped to your selection.

I hope that you find this addon useful!
